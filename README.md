# Experimental Material

The research is based on publicly available Providence Corpus (Demuth, K., Culbertson, J. & Alter, J. 2006. Word-minimality, epenthesis, and coda licensing in the acquisition of English. Language & Speech, 49, 137–174). The data are available in the CHILDES database (https://phon.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Providence.html).

For the current research, a dataset of all the utterances from the Providence corpus, provided by the authors of BabySLM benchmark (https://github.com/MarvinLvn/BabySLM).

Utterances containing phonological fragments (e.g. &, #) or unintelligible speech (e.g., annotated as &, xx, or yy) were excluded from further analysis (see CHAT transcription convention in https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html).
